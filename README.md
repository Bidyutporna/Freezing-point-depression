# **Determining the Cryoscopic Constant of Water**
When a solute is added to a pure solvent, the freezing point of the solution gets lower compared to the freezing point of the pure solvent. This phenomenon is known as freezing point depression. The extent to which this change occurs can be calculated using the equation:  

𝛥𝑇<sub>𝑓</sub> = −𝐾<sub>𝑓</sub> × 𝑏 × ⅈ
                                                     
Where  𝛥𝑇<sub>𝑓</sub> is the freezing point depression, 𝐾<sub>𝑓</sub> is the cryoscopic constant, 𝑏  is the molality and ⅈ is the Van’t Hoff factor. 

**The objective of this project is to determine the cryoscopic constant of water in varying concentrated solutions. These results can be used in salting icy roads, processing food, and designing anti-freezers for automobiles.**

Using the codes attached, the freezing point of both the pure water and salt water can be determined graphically. The plateaus in the graph would represent the melting temperature. By substituting the difference in the melting temperature of pure water and salt water in the above equation, the cryoscopic constant of water can be determined.
